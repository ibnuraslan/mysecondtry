    <!-- <h2>position: static;</h2>
    <p>
      An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it
      is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:
    </p>
    <div class="static">This div element has position: static;</div> -->

    <!-- <h2>position: relative;</h2>
    <p>
      An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal
      position:
    </p>
    <div class="relative">This div element has position: relative;</div> -->

    <!-- <h2 style="margin-bottom: 900px;">position: fixed</h2>
    <p>
      An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal
      position:
    </p>
    <div class="fixed">this element has position: fixed</div> -->

    <!-- 
    <p>
      An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal
      position:
    </p> -->

    <!-- <h2 class="fixed" style="margin-bottom: 1900px">position: fixed;</h2>
    <p>
      An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport,
      which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is
      scrolled:
    </p>
    <div class="fixed">This div element has position: fixed;</div> -->

    <!-- <h2>position: absolute;</h2>
    <p>
      An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest
      positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like
      fixed):
    </p>
    <div class="relative">
      This div element has position: relative;
      <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute;</div>
    </div> -->

    <h2>position: sticky;</h2>
    <div class="sticky">I am sticky!</div>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 2000px">In this example, the sticky element sticks to the top of the page (top:0), when you reach its scroll position.</p>
    <p>Scroll back up to remove the stickyness.</p>
